These pillars are mostly practiced in object oriented programming languages such as java, python, c++ etc. Although can simply be described to other languages like c programming language.
ABSTRATION
Hides background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the required information.
It reduces complexity and increases efficiency..
From our program we can describe data abstraction from the point where we allowed only the user to see the necessary information and such information are the one in “printf” statements which allows or instruct a user to enter “Enter the LENGTH of the cube:” and finally get an output but do not show the process which lead to the result. 

INHERITANCE
A concept that acquires the properties from one class to another class. The importance in java is code reusability. Inheritance can be described or explained when we call a function, whereby we can use a particular function (Block of statements) multiple times to solve various problems.
From our program, we simply call a function ‘CalcArea’ So as to find the area of the cube and this simply describes code reusability process, where we used a particular block of code multiple times without rewriting it again.
So calling a function simply somehow explains the inheritance process. 
ENCAPSULATION
The process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
As described, the encapsulation process in c language relates to a function which performs a particular task whereby in our program we have three different functions with different functionalities, the first one calculates area, second to calculate perimeter and the third to calculate the volume but in object oriented programming language such as java there are sample of other features such as hiding the class or setting it to private.
POLYMORPHISM
Is the ability of an object to take many forms. It allows us to perform the same action in many different ways.
From our program, length has been passed through every function to obtain the results, from the function CalcArea it has been used to compute the area of the cube, for the function CalcPerimeter It has been used to calculate the perimeter and lastly for the function CalcVolume it has been used to compute the volume of the cube.
